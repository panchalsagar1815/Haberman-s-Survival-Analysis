# Haberman-s-Survival-Analysis

Project Title: Haberman Survival Analysis

Project Description:
The "Haberman Survival Analysis" project is a focused examination of a dataset containing key features related to patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital. The dataset includes the following features:

1. **Age:** This represents the age of the patients at the time of surgery, ranging from 30 to 83 years. It is retrieved using the code `haberdata['age']`.

2. **Year:** Denoting the year in which the patients underwent the operation, with a time frame spanning from 1958 to 1969.

3. **Nodes:** The number of lymph nodes, essential components of the lymphatic and immune systems, providing insights into the spread of cancer. (Reference: [Wikipedia - Lymph Node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node))

4. **Status:** Represented by values 1 and 2, where 1 indicates that the patient survived for 5 years or longer post-surgery, and 2 indicates that the patient succumbed within 5 years.

This project aims to employ statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the Haberman Survival dataset, extracting meaningful patterns and correlations. By exploring the relationships between age, year of operation, lymph node involvement, and survival status, the project seeks to identify factors influencing the survival outcomes of breast cancer patients.

The insights derived from this analysis can be invaluable for medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers in refining treatment strategies and improving prognostic accuracy for breast cancer patients. Through the "Haberman Survival Analysis" project, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance our understanding of survival dynamics in the context of breast cancer surgeries.
